<h1>The Rainbow Fish </h1>
<h2> By Marcus Pfister (1992) </h2>
  <div class="text" id="blue">

<p>A long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish.
Not just an ordinary fish, but the most beautiful fish in the
entire ocean. His scales were every shade of blue and
green and purple, with sparkling silver scales among them.</p>

<p>The other fish were amazed at his beauty. They called
him Rainbow Fish. “Come on, Rainbow Fish,” they would call. “Come
and play with us!” But the Rainbow Fish would just glide past, proud
and silent, letting his scales shimmer.</p>

<p>One day, a little blue fish followed after him. “Rainbow Fish,” he called, “wait for me!
Please give me one of your shiny scales. They are so wonderful, and you have so many.”
“You want me to give you one of special scales? Who do you think you are?” cried the
Rainbow Fish. “Get away from me!” Shocked, the little blue fish swam away. He was so upset; he
told all his friends what had happened. From then on, no one would have anything to do with the
Rainbow Fish. They turned away when he swam by.</p>
