  - I learned how to create accent colors that bring the whole website together without making it look overwhelming.
3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
  - For this assignment I started by thinking about what I wanted to build a website for. I decided to build a website for my brother-in-law's coffee shop based in Antigua, Guatemala. He already has social media pages but didn't have an actual website. I gathered material from his social media pages and used his real Coffea logo as the base for my design. I incorporated the colors from the logo with other colors that seemed modern and went well togther. From there I decided what the other pages should be and how they would flow together. I ended up with a website that I am proud of although I would have liked to make the social icon box smaller but still fixed on the side in the middle.
