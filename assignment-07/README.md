1. Divs are block-level elements that group other elements together. Spans are elements that exist within divs and do not create full-width blocks. The class attribute is the identifer and selector value for HTML elements.
2. "alt text" element is short for alternative element. It is there in case the media doesn't load and the viewers need to see what they might be missing. So if I have a picture of a dog on a door step I might name it alt="dog on door step."
3.  - When I added my image to this weeks assignment it wasn't coming up. Thankfully my alt text was but I couldn't figure out why it wouldn't load the actual picture.
    - For my work cycle this week I started with the walk-through video. It took me a lot longer than when I start with the website.
