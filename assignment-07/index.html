<p>
Picture-perfect, you don't need no filter <br />
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer <br />
Shower you with all my attention <br />
Yeah, these are my only intentions <br />
Stay in the kitchen, cooking up, cut your own bread <br />
Heart full of equity, you're an asset <br />
Make sure that you don't need no mentions <br />
Yeah, these are my only intentions <br /> </p>
<p>
Shout out to your mom and dad for making you <br />
Standing ovation, they did a great job raising you <br />
When I create, you're my muse <br />
The kind of smile that makes the news <br /> </p>
<p>
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets <br />
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast <br />
You make it easy to choose <br />
You got a mean touch I can't refuse (no, I can't refuse it)  <br /> </p>
<p>
Picture-perfect, you don't need no filter <br />
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer <br />
Shower you with all my attention <br />
Yeah, these are my only intentions <br />
Stay in the kitchen, cooking up, cut your own bread <br />
Heart full of equity, you're an asset <br />
Make sure that you don't need no mentions <br />
Yeah, these are my only intentions <br />
</p> <p>
Already passed, you don't need no approval <br />
Good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal <br />
Second to none, you got the upper hand now <br />
Don't need a sponsor, no, you're the brand now <br />
You're my rock, my Colorado <br /> <p>
Got that ring, just like Toronto <br />
Love you now, a little more tomorrow <br />
That's how I feel <br />
Act like you know that you are <br /> </p>
<p>
Picture-perfect, you don't need no filter <br />
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer <br />
Shower you with all my attention <br />
Yeah, these are my only intentions <br />
Stay in the kitchen, cooking up, cut your own bread (whip it) <br />
Heart full of equity, you're an asset (asset) <br />
Make sure that you don't need no mentions (yeah, yeah) <br />
Yeah, these are my only intentions (Quavo) <br /> </p>
<p>
No cap, no pretending <br />
You don't need mentions (no cap) <br />
Got them saying "goals", they don't wanna be independent <br />
Tell them to mind your business <br />
We in our feelings <br />
It's fifty-fifty percentage (fifty) <br />
Attention, we need commitment <br />
We gotta both admit it (both) <br />
It's funny we both listen (both) <br />
It's a blessing 'cause we both get it (both) <br />
You the best thing and I don't need a witness (best thing) <br />
I'ma find me a ring and pray it's perfect fitted (perfect) <br /> </p>
<p>
Picture-perfect, you don't need no filter (no filter) <br />
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer (oh) <br />
Shower you with all my attention (I will) <br />
Yeah, these are my only intentions (yeah )<br /> </p>
<p>
Stay in the kitchen, cooking up, cut your own bread (you do) <br />
Heart full of equity, you're an asset (uh huh) <br />
Make sure that you don't need no mentions (no mentions) <br />
Yeah, these are my only intentions (only intentions) <br />
(That's all I plan to do, ooh) <br /> </p>
