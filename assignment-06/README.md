1. One form that I come across a lot is on Facebook, specifically the create post bar. It serves as a way to type something and post it on Facebook. Another form I use a lot is the search bar on YouTube. This form allows me to look for specific videos that I want to use.
2. An example of a text input is the text boxes on Instagram's home page that asks for your user name and password. An example of a selection input is on the IPSY website when you take a personalized beauty quiz and it asks you what your skin type is. Also, an example of a button input is the submit button when taking a quiz on the Moodle website.
3. My work cycle:
      - I started by adding the 4 main document elements.
      - I then added a heading using the h1 tag.
      - Then I used the address element to add the address of Black Coffee.
      - I then added the table style element to add solid black .5 borders.
      - I used the email link to add their email.
      - I created a table with rows that were labled Days/Times and then cells that explained what days/times they are open.
      - I then used the form and action elements to say where these would be posted and what would happen.
      - Then I used an the text input element two different times to ask separate questions. I also used the selection input to create a drop down of different options.
      - Lastly, I used the button element to combine a picture with the submit button.
