1. I have really enjoyed learnign HTML even though there is A LOT of steps. I'm finally starting to get the hang of the four main document elements and markup language such as lists and semantic markup. I'm still trying to get a grasp on all the form elements and had to revist that site a lot more than the other ones. I'm still trying to understand things from the media section like id's and divs but working with them more this week helped me gain a better understanding. It was fun to learn how to style each the pages. This was very new for me but I had a lot of fun learning. The design element is definetly my favorite area.
2. I'm excited for next week's module! I love interior design and art so I will be really interested to see how the decorating of HTML comes about. I'm a little nervous to see how much it takes to create a well-designed website.
3. This week I started by reading through the assignment 8 module and then looked over what the homework assignment was. I then watched the tutorial video as I was going along in my own atom project. This worked a lot better than watching the video first like I did last week.
