1. My imaginary client was a hair salon business. They wanted a fun and bright page using pinks and purples. They wanted a place where they could talk about the services they offered, explain what there business was about and a place for clients to get in touch with them.
2. The display: block; element forces things to stack on top of eachother. The rule display: inline; forces elements to flow together on a the screen and only take up as much room as needed. The display: inline-block; rule removes new lines inherent in block elements. Unlike display: inline;, display: inline-block; also forces elements around it.
3. I was unable to get the picture on the about page in the spot I wanted it. I start to get confused when there's so much material to fit in one project and then I get lost. I think it will just take more practice. I also was unable to get the social media links over to the right.
