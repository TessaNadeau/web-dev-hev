    <h1>Kindness</h1>
    <h2>Naomi Shihab Nye</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Before you know what kindness really is<br />
      you must lose things,<br />
      feel the future dissolve in a moment<br />
      like salt in a weakened broth.<br />
      What you held in your hand,<br />
      what you counted and carefully saved,<br />
      all this must go so you know<br />
      how desolate the landscape can be<br />
      between the regions of kindness.<br />
      How you ride and ride<br />
      thinking the bus will never stop,<br />
      the passengers eating maize and chicken<br />
      will stare out the window forever.<br /></p>
