1. The universal selector is used to style every element on the page. You would use this if you want everythingto follow the same patter. The element selector selects only elements of a certain type. For example, You would use that element if you wanted multiple headings to have the same elements. Class names can be used to style elements. You would use these selectors to select elements that serve the same function. The ID selector is like a class selector because it allows you to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID. You would use the ID element to make an even more specific selection.
2. I actually chose four colors because I didn't realize it was limited to three so I hope that's okay! The colors I chose were blue, red, yellow, rose and green for the middle color. I chose these colors because they were common colors in the 1920's and I used the colors that are found in the middle picture of cartoon women from the 1920's.
  -Blue: #152a75
  -Red: #bf2121
  -Yellow: #e0b044
  -Rose: #dd8fc0
  -Green: rgb(31, 112, 56, 0.5);
3. I started by reading through the material, then I watched the walkthrough video as I followed along on my own project. I then looked at the example and I was trying to make multipe straight lines of color go across the page but could only figure out how to do the squares. I also don't understand what the significance is of the top: 0; numbers and such. This was by far the hardest assignment for me.
