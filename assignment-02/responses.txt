1. One way that data travels on the internet is through a
fiber optic cable. This is a thread of glass that is
engineered to reflect light. You can send bits of information
as light beams from one place to another using this cable.
When you send a beam of light down the cable it
bounces up and down until it is received at the
other end. Depending on the direction it takes you
can send multiple things simultaneously.

2. DNS associates names with corresponding addresses. Your
computer uses the addresses to look up the domain names and
get the associated IP address which is used to connect your
computer to the destination on the internet.

3. Cookies are what websites use to remember who you are. They
are ID numbers that a website holds onto once you log
in so that when you return it remembers you.

4. Three basic parts of a URL
      Protocol (Country) - states how the browser will
      communicate with the server.
      Domain (State, City) - main direction to your
      site.
      Path - step by step directions to the final
      room.
